			<h1>Basketball</h1><hr>
			<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br></p>
			<p><em> This article is about the sport. For the ball used in the sport, see Basketball (ball). 
			For other uses, see <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_(disambiguation)">Basketball(disambiguation)</a>.</em></p>
			<p>
<strong>Basketball</strong> is a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_sport">team sport </a> in which two teams, most commonly of five players each,
opposing one another on a rectangular <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_court"> court</a>, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball 
(approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) 
while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
A <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)">field goal</a> is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, 
when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.
The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
			</p>
			<p>
Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill. On offense, 
players may use a variety of shots – the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">layup</a>, the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">jump shot</a>, or a <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">dunk</a>;
 on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, 
a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dribble">hold the
ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</a>
			</p>
		<p>		
		The five players on each side fall into five <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">playing positions.</a> The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a 
		slightly shorter but more agile player is the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">small forward,</a> and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">shooting guard</a> and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). 
		Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.</p>

Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">James Naismith</a> in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Springfield,</a> Massachusetts,
United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.
[1]<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">The National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) is the most significant <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">professional basketball</a> league in the world in 
terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.[2][3] Outside North America, the top clubs from 
national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Basketball Champions 
League Americas.</a> The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">FIBA Basketball World Cup</a> and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Men's Olympic Basketball</a> Tournament are the major 
international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.
Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">EuroBasket</a>and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">
FIBA AmeriCup.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national 
teams from continental championships. The main North American league is the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I 
Basketball Championship</a> is also popular), 
whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">EuroLeague Women.</a>

		<p><img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commothumb/2/20/James_Naismith_at_Springfield_College_circa_1920.jpg/248px-James_Naismith_at_Springfield_College_circa_1920.jpg"

In December 1891, <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith">James Naismith</a>, a Canadian professor of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education">physical education</a> and instructor at the International <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA">
Young Men's Christian Association</a> Training School (now Springfield College) in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Springfield, Massachusetts,[4]</a> was trying
 to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.[5] He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New
 England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball int
 o a basket mounted on a wall. 
Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored.
 This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.

	Old style basketball with laces
Basketball was originally played with a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)">soccer ball.</a> These round balls from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">"association football"</a> were made, at the time, with a set of laces 
to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.[6][7] These
 laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.[8] Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith. 
 (Whereas in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">American football,</a> the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.) The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_D._%22Tony%22_Hinkle">Tony Hinkle</a>, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the "bounce pass" to teammates. Passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. 
 Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.[dubious – discuss] Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.[9]
		</p>
		<p><img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Basketball_historic.tif/lossless-page1-255px-Basketball_historic.tif.png" alt = "Picture" align = "right" width = "210">
 The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through. 
 Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point. Whichever team got the most points won the game.[10] The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, 
 but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.
 [11] Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006,
 indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">duck on a rock,</a> as many had failed before it. 
		</p>
		<p>Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game. 
Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">game</a> started. Mahan suggested that it be called "Naismith ball", at which he laughed, 
saying that a name like that would kill any game. Mahan then said, "Why not call it basketball?" Naismith replied, "We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it."[12][13] 
The first official game was played in the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">YMCA gymnasium in Albany,</a> New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players. 
The game ended at 1–0; the shot was made from 25 feet (7.6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Streetball</a> or <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) court.
		</p>
		<p>		
At the time, soccer was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11). When winter weather got too icy to play soccer, 
teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side. By 1897–1898 teams of five became standard.

		<h3>College basketball</h3>

		<p> <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Kansas_U_team_1899.jpg/330px-Kansas_U_team_1899.jpg" alt = "Pic" align = "right" >Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada. 
	By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools. While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, 
	within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission. However, other amateur sports clubs, 
	colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">World War I,</a> the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Amateur Athletic Union</a>
	and the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States </a>(forerunner of the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">NCAA</a>) vied for control over the rules for the game.
	The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only lasted five years.
		</p>
		<p>James Naismith was instrumental in establishing <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">college basketball.</a> His colleague C.O. 
	Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Pittsburgh Geneva College.[14]</a> 
	Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach Forrest "Phog" Allen. 
	Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the University of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the University of Kentucky. 
	On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Hamline University</a> between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">University of Minnesota.[15][16][17]</a> The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.
		</p>
		<p>
In 1901, colleges, including the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">University of Chicago,</a> Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S. Naval Academy, 
the University of Colorado and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Yale University</a> began sponsoring men's games. In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">President Theodore Roosevelt</a> to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). In 1910, that body changed its name to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at YMCA in Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill University – Naismith's alma mater – visited Queen's University. 
McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome. A good turnout of spectators watched the game.[18]
		</p>
		<p>
The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics</a> (NAIA) 
tournament, was organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament began one year later. College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of
 players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">point shaving.</a> Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament.

Before widespread <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">school district</a> consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts. During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America. Perhaps the most 
legendary of high school teams was Indiana's <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Franklin Wonder Five,</a> which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition.
	</p>
	<p>
Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">varsity</a> competition.[19] Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the 
identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation.
In the 2016–17 season, 980,673 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">National Federation of State High School Associations.[20]</a>
The states of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky are particularly well known for their residents' 
devotion to high school basketball, commonly called Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film Hoosiers shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.
	</p>
	<p>
There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion. The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1930. 
The event was organized by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Amos Alonzo Stagg</a> and sent invitations to state champion teams. The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew. In 1929 it had 29 state champions. Faced with opposition from the 
National Federation of State High School Associations and <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">North Central Association of Colleges and Schools</a> that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930. 
The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks.[21] The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.
	</p>
	<p>The <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament</a> ran from 1924 to 1941 at <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Loyola University.[22]</a>
The National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues, including 
Catholic University, Georgetown and George Mason.[23] The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at Hampton Institute.[24] 
The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at Tuskegee Institute. Following a pause during World War II it resumed at Tennessee State College in Nashville.
 The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education began an integration of schools. The last tournaments were held at <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball">Alabama State College</a> from 1964 to 1967.[25]</p>
